    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic mb-4 sans">By Keith Ryan N. Almanzor &middot; July 24, 2025</p>

    <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <p class="indent-8">Back when I first got into tech, I believed it was my ticket to success. I thought I’d learn web development, start freelancing, and make big money. It looked like a simple path: learn how to build websites, get clients, and get paid. Plus, I've seen from Indeed that Computer Science offered tons of high-paying jobs—like software engineer, database administrator, UX designer, mobile app developer, IT project manager, and even data scientist. Seeing all those careers with great salaries made it feel like I had picked the right field. But everything changed when AI exploded.</p>

      <p class="indent-8">I started seeing how fast AI tools could build websites—sometimes better than what I could do myself. That scared me. I asked myself, What’s the point of learning something if a machine can already do it faster and easier? That’s when I started to feel lost and unsure.</p>

      <p class="indent-8">So, I shifted to studying Computer Science. I thought it was a broader field with more job options. But even there, I saw how AI was involved in everything—from automating code to generating ideas. It made me feel like AI wasn’t just a tool; it was competition.</p>

      <p class="indent-8">At one point, I even thought maybe I should just focus on AI itself, like everyone else seemed to be doing. But the deeper I looked, the more I realized: AI isn't always the answer.</p>

      <p class="indent-8">Sure, AI is helpful. It makes tasks faster. It can assist with writing, coding, researching, and more. But it can also make people lazy. When we start letting AI think for us, we stop practicing how to think on our own. I noticed how easy it was to just type a prompt and let AI do the work for me. That’s when I realized: we should try first—use our own mind—and then use AI to polish or improve what we already did. If we let AI do everything, we're not growing. We’re just copying.</p>

      <p class="indent-8">And even though AI looks perfect on the surface, it has flaws too. It doesn’t always think the way we do—and sometimes, that leads to unfair results. For example, a study from the University of Illinois (2024) found that AI tools like ChatGPT often misjudge non-native English speakers. More than half of their writing was wrongly flagged as AI-generated, while native English writing passed almost perfectly. That kind of bias can hurt real people—students, workers, and anyone trying to use these tools fairly. It shows that AI still needs human guidance, and we can’t just let it take over without asking questions or checking results.</p>

      <p class="indent-8">Another study pointed out something else: AI doesn’t just affect how we work—it affects how we feel. Researchers found that using AI tools in school can influence students' mental health, confidence, and motivation (Wu et al., 2024). If we depend too much on AI, we might lose trust in our own abilities. That’s not just a tech problem—it’s a personal one.</p>

      <p class="indent-8">If I could share one thing with others who are interested in tech, it’s this: don’t let AI replace your ability to think. Use it as a tool, not a crutch. Try to solve problems by yourself first. Then, if you need help, use AI to improve your answer. That way, you're still learning, thinking, and growing. Tech is changing fast. But we should still be the ones leading it—not just watching it happen.</p>
