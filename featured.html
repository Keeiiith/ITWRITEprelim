    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic mb-4 sans">By Aldrich Gavriel Sabando &middot; July 19, 2025</p>

    <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <p class="indent-8">In today’s world, Computer Science has become a popular course, and many college students are choosing to pursue it. Most believe it can lead to success and financial stability, more so than other programs, or so they think. Due to the rising number of students in the program, the job market has become increasingly competitive, especially with the promised high salary. Landing a job is no longer easy. In the Philippines, the IT‑BPM sector is expected to grow by 7% in 2024, reaching about 1.82 million jobs. Industry forecasts estimate this will increase to 2.5 million by 2028 (Reuters, 2024).</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">Many Computer Science majors aim to become software engineers; a well-known and lucrative profession that involves the development and maintenance of software applications and systems. Some are drawn to the prestige of being called an “engineer,” and while that’s understandable, it’s important to realize that software engineering, though promising, is not the only path available to CS graduates.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">However, there is a growing concern: the rise of automation, driven by artificial intelligence. With AI becoming more common in the industry, tasks that were once done manually are now being automated. In some cases, AI can even generate functional code with the right prompts, something that used to be the domain of software engineers. As one AI expert stated in an interview, “We’re in an AI revolution, and I am a specialist in the kind of AI that we’re doing the revolution with, and I can’t find anything” (Horowitch, 2025). This highlights how even experts in the field are feeling the impact of automation.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">Job interviews in tech are becoming more intense. Companies receive hundreds of applications, and even those who are interviewed often fail to secure a position. Some believe that the only way to get hired is through connections. Because of these difficulties, some graduates are choosing to leave the tech industry and search for other ways to make ends meet.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">Still, it’s important to remember that Computer Science is a versatile field. There are many career paths aside from software engineering. Opportunities exist in data science, analytics, and cybersecurity, a field growing in importance as more of our lives and assets become dependent on technology.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">Computer Science will continue to play a role across all industries. As businesses needed to adapt to rapid technological changes, especially those that involve AI, they needed professionals who could help improve and maintain their systems. No other group is as prepared for that task as Computer Science graduates.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">We should learn to work with AI, using it as a tool to become more efficient. However, we must not become dependent on it. Even though AI can write code quickly, we still need skilled professionals who can review, understand, and ensure its quality (Monash University, n.d.).</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">Lastly, we should stay optimistic. If we truly want to work in the tech industry, we must keep learning, stay updated with the latest advancements, and remain persistent. Keep applying. Keep growing. And never stop doing what you love.</p>
