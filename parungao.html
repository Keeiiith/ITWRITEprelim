      <p class="indent-8">Gaming is my all-time favorite hobby. One of my earliest memories, at just four years old, was playing the classic Plants vs Zombies on our old desktop computer. Since then, my love for this hobby has only increased. What stemmed from this, however, is my curiosity for how it is made. This is where game development comes in. It is how games are made from a vision, into a playable masterpiece. At the heart of this process is the game engine, the central platform that runs the game. For beginners like me, there are two choices to pick from: Unity and Unreal.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">To understand how games are built, it is important to define what a game engine is. A game engine is a software framework optimized and specialized for the development of a video game. It includes the following as a software environment: 2D and 3D rendering pipelines, tweakable physics engine that simulates real life, sound engine, and script compilers (Arm Ltd., n.d.). These tools work together to ensure that a developed game runs and performs efficiently.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">Now that we know what game engines are, we can focus on the first engine, Unity. This engine has produced tons of your favorite games, such as Among Us, Pokémon Go, Cuphead, Genshin Impact, Fall Guys, and more (Team, 2024). As seen with these games, it can be used by a solo developer to a full-blown gaming company. This goes to show its flexibility, which is greatly contributed to by C#, the programming language used for the engine. This makes it easy to develop for students like me who are familiar with the language’s concepts and syntax. Furthermore, its cross-platform compatibility, wide range of dependencies, well-documented nature, and community support make it appealing for beginners (Juris, 2024). In contrast to its benefits, one of its major drawbacks is its lack of graphical fidelity. It lacks the tools and technologies to push graphics to their absolute limit, mimicking that of real life.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">In contrast, Unreal Engine puts graphical fidelity at the forefront, setting it apart from Unity. Games made by Unreal include Fortnite, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Black Myth: Wukong, and more. These games have one thing in common: they all look graphically stunning. Unlike Unity, Unreal provides advanced technologies such as Nanite (for real-time geometry) and Lumen (for dynamic lighting), giving developers the tools to pursue photorealism (Epic Games, 2023). Furthermore, Unreal uses C++, which is a complex programming language, but it allows for more direct manipulation of the computer’s components. This benefits advanced developers but presents a hurdle for most beginners. That is why it has an alternative method for manual scripting called Blueprints. It is a visual representation of scripting made for beginners. Instead of writing code to create and link variables, Blueprints use visual building blocks that can be connected with lines to control logic and variables. However, these benefits come at a cost: performance. Because Unreal prioritizes graphical fidelity, it demands higher-end hardware. This makes it difficult for students with low-spec machines to run, let alone develop games on the platform.</p>
    
      <p class="indent-8">Game Development is a lengthy process of making a game, and at its start is choosing a game engine. It would be in charge of most of the processes the game needs to run. As a beginner, we have two choices. The first is Unity with its flexibility, cross-platform, mature documentation, and community, making it attractive for beginners but lacking that of graphical fidelity. In contrast, Unreal prioritizes graphics but requires stronger hardware. Each engine has its own strengths and weaknesses. There is no one glove that fits all. Instead, choose the engine that aligns with your own goals and vision.</p>
